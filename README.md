# BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE: The BMAD Method for Claude Code
**Into the unforgiving banality of software development we reflexively march, clutching our glowing API keys like torches against the impenetrable desolation of technical debt.** The BMAD Method - us mad be-ings expedition into the tarred ocean of AI-assisted creation - transforms the milquetoast ritual of "vibe coding" into misty charades evoking a mouth full of chalk and clandestine photographs. Nine specialized personas stand ready, a psychogeographical stonehenge coaxing us into treacherous mountain passes of token gathering, cataclismic tomfoolery, and the final commit: deploying a containerized singularity which compiled once last Thursday.

Here, in this repository, lies our decrepit documentation of the journey - templates gesturing at meaning imposed upon the gaping void, workflows pretending the machine cares about our deadlines, and a methodology born from the quixotic dreams of script kiddies daring to believe AI could hypnotize the savage beast of framework debates.

## Core Features

**🎯 Intelligent Claude Code Integration**
- **Smart Persona Routing**: Claude automatically selects the right persona (Analyst, PM, Architect, Designer, Developer, DevOps, QA, Data Engineer, Orchestrator) based on your request
- **Adaptive Formality**: Process rigor adjusts to project complexity - quick fixes skip ceremony, complex features get full rigor
- **Session Continuity**: Multi-session planning with context preservation through documentation-driven workflows

**⚡ Streamlined Development**
- **Direct Task Navigation**: Jump to specific tasks without file browsing - just say what you need
- **Architecture-Agnostic**: Templates support any pattern (monolith, microservices, serverless, edge) without forced assumptions
- **Quality Built-In**: 13 validation checklists and comprehensive templates ensure professional standards

**📊 Visual Progress Tracking**
- **Optional BMAD Dashboard**: Next.js application for visualizing project ideas from exploration through MVP candidates
- **Viability Metrics**: Track business/technical balance with dual progress indicators
- **Anthropic Design**: Consistent branding with Claude Code's design system

## Quick Start

![Setup Script](media/setup-script.png)

### Automated Setup (Recommended)

Navigate to the root directory of your project and use the setup script to automatically configure BMAD:

**macOS/Linux/WSL:**

Single command (copy and paste entire block):
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cabinlab/BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE/main/setup-bmad.sh && \
chmod +x setup-bmad.sh && \
./setup-bmad.sh
```

**Windows Users:** Since Claude Code requires WSL, run the above bash command in your WSL terminal, not PowerShell.

The script will:
- Copy all necessary BMAD files to your project
- Create the proper directory structure
- Initialize planning journal and session files
- Let you choose between basic and enhanced Claude.md
- **Optional**: Install the BMAD Dashboard for visual progress tracking

<summary><strong>📋 Setup Instructions</strong></summary>

### Manual Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Copy these to your project root:
   - `bmad-agent/` folder (personas, templates, tasks, checklists, data)
   - `CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md` (rename to CLAUDE.md)
   - `BMAD-CLAUDE-CODE-GUIDE.md` (optional quick reference)
3. Create a `docs/` folder in your project for BMAD artifacts
4. Start using BMAD with Claude Code!

### Using BMAD with Claude Code

**Starting a New Project:**
```
User: "Let's plan a new app using BMAD"
Claude Code: I'll help you start a new BMAD project. Let me set up the planning structure...
```

**Continuing Work:**
```
User: "Continue BMAD planning"
Claude Code: I see we were working on the PRD as the Product Manager...
```

**Key Commands:**
- **"Act as the BMAD [Persona]"** - Claude adopts specific persona mindset
- **"Create a [document]"** - Uses appropriate BMAD template
- **"Run [checklist]"** - Executes quality validation
- **"Show planning status"** - Reviews progress and next steps

**Usage Examples:**
- **Direct Requests**: "Build authentication" → [Developer] starts implementation
- **Create Documents**: "Create user stories" → [PM] drafts stories  
- **Design Systems**: "Design the database" → [Data Engineer] creates schema
- **Quality Gates**: "Run architecture checklist" → Validates design decisions

<summary><strong>⚙️ Session Management Options</strong></summary>

### Basic Setup (CLAUDE.md)
Use for simple, single-session projects:
- Copy `CLAUDE.md` as-is to your project root
- No session tracking needed  
- Best for small features or quick prototypes
- All planning happens in one session

### Enhanced Setup (CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md)  
For complex, multi-session planning:
- Copy `CLAUDE-ENHANCED.md` to your project root and rename to `CLAUDE.md`
- Includes efficiency enhancements, session continuity, and planning journal support
- Best for full application development with extended planning phases
